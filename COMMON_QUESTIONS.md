# Commonly Asked Questions

1. **What is "HMDA Pilot"?**

 This HMDA Pilot is part of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's](http://consumerfinance.gov/) (CFPB) work to improve the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) electronic reporting process for financial institutions. The CFPB is testing whether the HMDA Pilot application makes it easier for HMDA filers to review, validate and correct HMDA file submission edits. This site does not in any way alter or substitute your obligations for submitting data under HMDA. See [ffiec.gov/hmda](http://ffiec.gov/hmda) for more details about your legal obligations.

1. **Where can I find the file format for the HMDA Dataset I would like to validate with the HMDA Pilot tool?**

 The HMDA Pilot tool will accept 2013 or 2014 [properly formatted HMDA .DAT files](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/fileformats.htm).

1. **Which of the HMDA edits does the HMDA Pilot tool validate?**

 The HMDA Pilot tool will validate syntactical, validity, quality and macro quality edits as described in the [validation edits documentation](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/edits.htm) on the FFIEC website.

1. **Why can't I skip ahead from Syntactical/Validity to Quality before fixing my Syntactical/Validity edit errors?**

 When you recheck the file that you have fixed, you need to recheck the full file and not just the changes.

1. **Why does the progress bar seem to stop at 100% when processing my HMDA file?**

 When the number of loans present in your file is greater than the number specified in your transmittal sheet the progress may appear to be stopped while the system processes the unexpected loans.

1. **Where can I find out more information about the HMDA Process and my filing obligations?**

 HMDA information can be found in several places. A link to the regulation can be found on the CFPB regulation site [here](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/regulations/#ecfr). The [HMDA Reporting Getting it Right! Guide](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/guide.htm) is also a valuable resource for assisting institutions in their HMDA reporting. It includes a summary of responsibilities and requirements, directions for assembling the necessary tools, and instructions for reporting HMDA data.

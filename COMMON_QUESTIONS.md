# Commonly Asked Questions

1. Why can't I skip ahead from Syntactical/Validity to Quality before fixing my Syntactical/Validity edit errors?

 When you recheck the file that you have fixed, you need to recheck the full file and not just the changes.

1. Why does the progress bar seem to stop at 100% when processing my HMDA file?

 When the number of loans present in your file is greater than the number specified in your transmittal sheet the progress may appear to be stopped while the system processes the unexpected loans.

# About

The HMDA Pilot is a work in progress by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://consumerfinance.gov/) to provide a new way to validate HMDA data. The application makes it easier to review and verify validation edits.

## Validate a HMDA Dataset

1. **Select a .DAT file**

    On the File and Validate page (Step 1), select a properly formatted .DAT file and filing year, then click the Start Validation button. When the validation starts, the file will remain on your computer and will not be uploaded.

2. **Validate Data**

    The validation edits must be performed in the order shown below. For each step, the file must pass all edits and be verified before proceeding with the next step.

    * Syntactical & Validity Edits
    * Quality & Macro Edits
    * MSA and IRS Edits

3. **Review Edit Reports**

    Validation errors will be displayed in the Edit Reports and Edit Details pages. If needed, make corrections in your system of record and revalidate the entire file (starting at Step 1).

4. **Review Validation Summary**

    After all edits are complete the Validation Summary will display the Respondent and File information. You do not need to submit the validated file or send an additional information.
